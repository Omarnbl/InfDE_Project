# Pix2Pix GAN 

## Overview

This folder contains multiple **Jupyter Notebooks** used for training various Pix2Pix GAN models designed for **medical image synthesis**, specifically generating **realistic LGE MRI images** from input segmentation masks of the **left ventricle**, which include **infarction** and **no-reflow** regions.

Training experiments explore variations in:
- **Generator/Discriminator architectures**
- **Image resolution**
- **Loss functions**
- **Region-specific weighting**

A subfolder named **Best Models** contains a link to download the top-performing trained models from all experiments.

## How to Use

1. Open any notebook in the **Notebooks** folder.
2. Configure parameters or weights as needed.
3. Train the model using GPU if available.
4. Evaluate performance using standard GANs metrics (FID, IS, etc.).
5. For the best pretrained models, refer to the [Best Models](https://github.com/hanaheshamm/GP_InfDE/tree/main/Code/GANs/Pix2Pix%20GAN/Best%20Models) folder.

## Notes

- Models were trained on **grayscale medical images**.
- Custom **weighted L1 loss** emphasizes critical regions like infarction and no-reflow zones.
- Region-specific weights were tuned iteratively for optimal performance.
